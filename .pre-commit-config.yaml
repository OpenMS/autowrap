# Pre-commit hooks for autowrap
# This is an optional configuration for developers who want to use pre-commit hooks.
# To use these hooks, install pre-commit and run:
#   pip install pre-commit
#   pre-commit install
#
# The hooks will then run automatically on each commit.
# To run manually on all files:
#   pre-commit run --all-files
