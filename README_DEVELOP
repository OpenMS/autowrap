Development setup
=================

The recommended way to work on `autowrap` is to use a virtual environment,
install the package in editable mode, and run the tests from the project root.

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   $ python -m venv .venv
   $ source .venv/bin/activate         # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

2. Install `autowrap` with development dependencies:

   $ python -m pip install -U pip
   $ python -m pip install -e .[dev]

   (Use `python3` instead of `python` if needed on your system.)

3. Run the test suite from the project root:

   $ pytest tests/ -v

   For local coverage, you can also use:

   $ ./run_test_coverage.sh

4. Verify the CLI is available:

   $ autowrap --help

These commands have been verified to work with the current `pyproject.toml`
configuration and are the preferred starting point for developing on `autowrap`.

from the projects directory.
